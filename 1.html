    <p>It's been a long day without you, my friend
    And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
    We've come a long way from where we began
    Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
    When I see you again </p>
    Damn, who knew?

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">All the planes we flew, good things we been through
    That I'd be standing right here talking to you
    'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
    But something told me that it wouldn't last
    Had to switch up, look at things different, se<p>To force<br> line breaks<br> in a text,<br> use the br<br> element.</p>e the bigger picture
    Those were the days, hard work forever pays
    Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
    </p>

    <br>Uh
    How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
    Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
    And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
